    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> 
        Hello, and welcome to my personal website. My name is Logan, and I am a proud graduate of Montana State University,
        with a BS degree in Computer Science. Solving problems creatively using software is my passion, and 
        I hope one day to be a confident and efficient software developer. I strive to constantly be learning,
        and yearn to add more tools to my disposal. We live in a constantly changing world, and use technology
        only dreamed of in science fiction mere decades ago.

        On this home page, you can find a personal summary of myself. Along the top of this page you can find a
        navigation bar with links to a digital version of my resumé, a small portfolio highlighting work I am 
        personally proud of, as well as some external links to my Github and my Linkedin. I am always open to
        opportunities to expand my skillset, so please feel free to reach out. Do NOT contact me with unsolicited
        services or offers.

    <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Billings, Montana, and graduated from Billings West High School
        in the year of 2016. At first, having a strong passion for playing video games in my free time, I
        naturally assumed that a video game designer was the career for me. After some research and reading
        several anecdotes concerning work conditions, I decided I was not the man for the job. However, I was
        still left with a burning passion for technology, and after I participated in an intro programming course my junior year, the
        seed had been planted. I enrolled in MSU, hearing good things about their computer science program, 
        and graduated with my degree. Along the way I had the pleasure of spending a summer internship at Figure 
        Technologies, a local tech company leveraging blockchain and automation in the home mortgage market. I consider
        the experience to be one of my most invaluable during my college career, and was introduced to
        core concepts used in industry such as version control and frontend development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from work-related activities, I am an avid outdoor and nature lover. Going on a hike, camping, disc golf, and 
        rock climbing are some of my favorite excuses to get outside. When the season permits it, I like to 
        go hunting for water fowl, and attempting to cook the meat (I'm not very good at it). When it comes to 
        being indoors, I enjoy listening to music and playing my guitar, as well as reading. My cat
        Quantanamo is a constant source of inspiration for me, and also a constant pain in my rear.

        application to keep track of him. <img src="Images/floof.png" alt="quant">
