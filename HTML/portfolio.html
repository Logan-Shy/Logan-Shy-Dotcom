            Below you will find descriptions and summaries of some of my public work that I'm most proud of, as well
            as some pictures if available. All of the code for the following is open source, and I encourage
            you to check out the implementation on my github for further documentation.

        <h2>Chonk Tracker</h2>
        <p>
            My most recent project (and most likely the one I'm most proud of) is an android
            application I lovingly refer to as the Chonk Tracker. My cat is a great actor,
            and sometimes my roommates and I have trouble knowing if the others have fed 
            him or not. Instead of texting and asking each other all the time or using a 
            whiteboard, I decided to make an app to keep track. My roommates and myself 
            simply download the android application from my github, which talks directly
            to a simple expressJS application running in the cloud. The backend stores and 
            sends the time, while the frontend will display the time and send POST requests. 
            All in all the idea is simple, however it's very effective for keeping my cat slim.

        <h2>Compiler</h2>
        <p>
            For my senior capstone project, I was assigned to a group and tasked with 
            creating a compiler from near-scratch using ANTLR, a code-generation tool 
            mainly used for lexing and parsing, for a simple programming language known as Little.
            The full grammar for the language can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/Logan-Shy/CSCI468-Compilers/blob/master/LittleGrammar.txt">
                Here
            </a> 
            . My team members were mostly responsible for any documentation and writing
            that needed to be done, while 100% of the coding was done by me. The 27 
            commits over the course of the semester shows I was the only contributor,
            so I am quite proud to say I wrote a fully functional compiler
            virtually single-handedly. The compiler takes in an input file written in
            Little and produces an executable that performs the instructions.
